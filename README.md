# CSCD58 Assignment-1
- This was the programming portion of CSCD58 Assignment 1, where we were given starter code that takes in messages between clients and servers. 
- The goal here was to modify them in order to have a shut-down option, and timestamps for when messages were sent.
- See ```About.md``` for how to test the program.
- For more information on CSCD58, see [here](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/cscd58h3).

# TODO:
- Adding testcases to run the whole process.
